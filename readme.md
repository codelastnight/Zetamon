Code now in BETA!

What does this mean?
 - I have successfully converted the design into a wordpress theme to work seamlessly with our current website setup

 What works?
 - Home page has a landing page, and is editable ( though kind of janky)
 - Menu, animation js, header is functional
 - mobile version not broken yet
 - pages and posts will render given a link
