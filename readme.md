Code now in BETA!

What does this mean?
 - I have successfully converted the design into a wordpress theme to work seamlessly with our current website setup

 What works?
 - Home page has a landing page, and is editable ( though kind of janky)
 - Menu, animation js, header is functional
 - mobile version not broken yet
 - pages and posts will render given a links 
 - you can now see multiple posts
 
 
 
 Issues :
 - optimizations:
   - literally dies on shitty connections
   - doesnt work on edge
   - lags on slow machines
 - calandar is janky as fu
 - no contact page
